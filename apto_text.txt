Sample text (subject to change, since not all features might be implemented by the end of hack week):

Hi, my name is Apto!
I am here to help you set up, manage, and test your server.
I can copy and paste channels, roles, emojis, as well as ban info to new servers,
quickly clone roles, and show you which role can do what.
As a plus, I include features for temporarily muting or banning users,
and I offer possibilities to restrict chats to image-only, emoji-only, text-only,
gif-only or reaction-only for certain roles. I can also ensure that some roles
cannot add reactions.
Oh, and I can ping roles for you, but only if you have the permissions to do so.
And should you ever need it, I can also offer you a freeze or lockdown mode to
immediately pause all chats and solve terrible issues at hand.

Ver 2. Edited version! 

Hi, my name is Apto!

I am here to help you set up, manage, and test your server. 
I can copy and paste channels, roles, emojis, as well as ban info to new servers, 
quickly create roles for your community needs, and show you what you can do with these roles! 
Muting and banning trolls and troublemakers is my second job, 
so you don't have to worry about keeping a constant eye on everything at once. 
I am here to watch your back!
Should you ever need to restrict the chats into text-,image- or gif-only mode, it would be my pleasure to assist you!
I can ensure clear role restrictions. 
Freezing and locking down a channel will be made easy in case of emergencies or fun viewer-only events. 

Let me assist in creating a safe and enjoyable space for you and your community!

Zari's one-liners:

1. Ahh, it's cozy here! Welcome to my channel, this is the place from where I'll operate.

2. I am here to set up your server for you.

3. I can help you with creating new roles and channels, and I can also load pre-made server templates for you.

4. Here's a selection:

5. Be careful when importing server templates. If you overwrite your server, you will lose all messages posted in your channels.

6. I can back up your server layout, but be aware that I cannot back up the messages sent in your server's channels.

7. You can check out all commands by typing "help".

8. Please make sure to provide a link to a server file that I created, so that I can load it.
You can right-click the server file that I sent you upon exporting, and then click "Copy Link" to quickly get access to the link.

9. If you uploaded your own server.json file, you can right click it and select "Copy Link" to get the link to the file. Discord stores all uploaded files internally, it's quite useful.

10. To try out server importing, it is best if you create a new server and invite me, so we can try it out together!

11. Everybody, freeze!

12. We need to take care of something real quick, so please be patient! :sweat_smile:

13. We need a break, for now. I am sure this channel will thaw eventually!

14. Psshhht, quiet now. :look_around:

Planned or implemented features: (in this order)
- export and import:

    - import server layout (selectively only channels, roles, emojis, ban info) - (TODO: implement)
    - clone roles (directly on the server, cloning all permissions but giving a new name, good for decorative roles/tags just used for colours and titles) - (TODO: implement)
    - clone channels (directly on the server, cloning all permissions but giving a new name, good for several channel topics) - (TODO: implement)
- server info:
    - list own roles (if you can't click on your user profile for some reason) - (TODO: implement) (not really worth mentioning in the voice acting though)
    - show role information (who can access and do what in which channel) - (TODO: implement)
    - show permissions (for a specific user, combines role information of all roles this user has) - (TODO: implement)
    - show channel information (which role can do what on a specific channel) - (TODO: implement)
    - list all admins - (TODO: find out how to identify people with admin permissions & implement)
    - list all nitro boosters - (TODO: find out how to identify the nitro booster role & implement)
- server management:
    - temporarily ban a user - (TODO: implement and ensure that it works with export/import)
    - temporarily mute a user - (TODO: implement)
    - restrict channels or roles (or roles in channels) to emoji-only, reaction-only, text-only, image-only, gif-only - (TODO: implement)
    - ability to block new users from joining the server (account needs a minimum ag - (TODO: implement)
    - server lockdown mode (freeze all channels for users below a given role to quickly identify and remove malicious users or bots or just to take a breather) - (TODO: implement)
- nice to have:
    - ping roles (if your role has the permission to do so) - (TODO: implement)
    - keep tracked of kicked user info - (TODO: implement)
    - calendar/schedule & sign up for meetings - (TODO: implement)
    - tracking which user joined with which invite link - (TODO: is this even doable? implement)
    - chat reminders and conversation inspirations (hydration reminder, "what seems to inspire you today?", TODO: implement)

What I would like to see:
- Several variations of things Xan can record for an introduction video.
- Variations of text that we can place on the main page of our bot to quickly show the most powerful features and that advertise our bot.
- Ideas for things he could say in different scenarios: in lockdown mode for example, he might be like "EVERYBODY! FREEZE!" :D
    - imagine a small artwork of him being posted in all channels as they get frozen
